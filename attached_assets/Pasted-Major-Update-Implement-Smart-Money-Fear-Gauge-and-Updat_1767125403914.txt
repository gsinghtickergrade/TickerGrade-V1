Major Update: Implement "Smart Money" Fear Gauge and Update Documentation.

Please perform the following two tasks to upgrade Pillar E (Event Risk).

### PART 1: BACKEND LOGIC (The Code)
Our FMP plan lacks options data, so we must switch to `yfinance` for this specific feature.

1.  **Install Library:** Ensure `yfinance` is installed in the Python environment.
2.  **Create Option Logic:**
    - Import `yfinance as yf`.
    - Create a helper function `get_put_call_ratio(ticker)`:
        - Fetch ticker: `stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)`
        - **Target Date:** Find the expiration date closest to **30 days from today**.
        - Fetch Chain: `chain = stock.option_chain(target_date)`
        - **Calculate:** Sum `calls['volume']` and `puts['volume']`.
        - **Result:** Return `puts_vol / calls_vol` (Handle division by zero).
3.  **Update Pillar E Scoring:**
    - Keep the existing FMP "Earnings Date" check (do not remove it).
    - Add the new PCR check:
        - If **PCR > 2.0** (High Bearish Hedging) -> Penalize score by **-2.0** points and set Status to "Warning".
        - If **PCR < 0.5** (Excessive Call Buying) -> Set Status to "Greed" (Neutral score).
    - **Safety Fallback:** Wrap the `yfinance` call in a `try/except` block. If it fails, default PCR to 0.7 so the app doesn't crash.

### PART 2: FRONTEND CONTENT (The Text)
Update the 'About / Methodology' page to explain this new logic.

1.  **Update 'Pillar 5' Description:**
    Replace the Pillar 5 text with:
    > **5. Event Risk (The Guardrail & Fear Gauge):**
    > "We hate surprises. The system runs a dual-layer safety check:
    > * **Calendar Risk (FMP):** We track the official Earnings Calendar. If a report is due within 15 days, we lock the score to 'Wait' to protect you from binary volatility events.
    > * **Smart Money Fear Gauge (Yahoo Data):** We calculate the real-time **Put/Call Ratio** from the options market. If we detect a sudden spike in Put volume (institutions hedging against a drop), we penalize the score even if the price chart looks perfect."

2.  **Update 'Data Sources':**
    Add Yahoo Finance to the source list:
    > "Our algorithms rely on raw, institutional-grade data feeds:
    > * **Company & Calendar Data:** Sourced directly from **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)**.
    > * **Macro Economics:** Sourced directly from the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)**.
    > * **Options Sentiment:** Sourced via **Yahoo Finance** market feeds."
