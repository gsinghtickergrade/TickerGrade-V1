MAJOR UPDATE: Convert to Multi-Page App with "Glass Box" Dashboard.

We are restructuring the app from a single scrolling page into a multi-page application using `react-router-dom`.

### PART 1: TECHNICAL SETUP
1. **Install:** Ensure `react-router-dom` is installed.
2. **Router Implementation:** Refactor `App.js` to use `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, and `<Route>`.
3. **Global Elements:**
   - Create a fixed-top **Navbar** (details below).
   - Ensure the **Footer** appears on every page.

### PART 2: THE NAVIGATION BAR
Create a responsive, modern Navbar fixed at the top:
- **Left:** "TickerGrade" Logo (Link to `/`).
- **Right:**
  - **Dashboard:** Link to `/` (Home).
  - **Methodology:** Link to `/methodology` (Deep Dive).
  - **User Guide:** Link to `/guide` (Cheat Sheet).
  - **Feedback:** A simple `mailto:your-email@example.com` link.
- **State:** Highlight the active link (e.g., bold or colored accent).

### PART 3: PAGE CONTENT & STRUCTURE

**1. PAGE: Dashboard (Route: `/`)**
   - **Goal:** The "Glass Box" Scanner. Immediate value + high-level philosophy.
   - **Top:** Search Bar & Main Chart (Existing).
   - **Middle (NEW):** Insert this "Philosophy Lead" immediately after the main score result but BEFORE the 5 Pillar Cards:
     > *Headline:* "Why TickerGrade?"
     > *Text:* "Most algorithms try to sell you a trade. TickerGrade tries to talk you out of it. We treat swing trading like a maritime operation: Safety comes first. If the Macro tide is out or volatility is too high, we penalize the score—even if the chart looks perfect. We only give a 'Green Light' when the probabilities are overwhelmingly in your favor."
   - **Bottom:** Keep the **Verdict Scoreboard** and the **5 Pillars Grid** here so users can see the "Engine Room" visually.
   - **Remove:** The long, detailed text blocks describing each pillar (move these to Methodology).

**2. PAGE: Methodology (Route: `/methodology`)**
   - **Goal:** The Technical Manual for power users.
   - **Content:** Move all the detailed "Inside the Engine" text blocks here.
   - **Add:** The "Data Sources" list at the bottom of this page.
   - **Detail:** Include the specific weights (e.g., "Technical Structure: 35%") alongside the descriptions.

**3. PAGE: User Guide (Route: `/guide`)**
   - **Goal:** A clean "Cheat Sheet" for interpreting signals.
   - **Content:**
     > **Headline:** How to Read Your Score
     > **Subtitle:** TickerGrade is a decision engine, not a crystal ball.

     > **The Scoreboard:**
     > * **8.0 - 10.0 (Strong Buy):** All systems go. Macro, Techs, and Fundamentals align.
     > * **6.0 - 7.9 (Buy):** Solid setup, but check for specific warnings.
     > * **4.0 - 5.9 (Hold):** Mixed signals. Usually means "Good Company, Bad Timing."
     > * **0.0 - 3.9 (Avoid):** Deteriorating conditions. Capital preservation mode.

     > **Critical Safety Features:**
     > * **Why is the Trade Setup hidden?** If a stock scores < 6.0, we hide targets to prevent forcing bad trades.
     > * **What is 'Event Risk'?** We lock scores to 'Wait' if Earnings are <15 days away, or if the Options Put/Call Ratio spikes > 2.0 (Institutional Fear).
