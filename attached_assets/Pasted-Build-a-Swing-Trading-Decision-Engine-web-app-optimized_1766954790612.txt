Build a "Swing Trading Decision Engine" web app optimized for a 30-90 day trading timeframe. This is a clean build request.

### PHASE 1: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & LIBRARIES
1. **Backend:** Python (Flask/Quart).
2. **Frontend:** React (Vite).
3. **Libraries to Install:**
   - `fredapi` (Federal Reserve Data)
   - `pandas_ta` (Technical Analysis)
   - `textblob` (Sentiment Analysis)
   - `requests` (for FMP API)
4. **Configuration:**
   - Load `FMP_API_KEY` and `FRED_API_KEY` from environment variables.
   - **Crucial:** Implement Server-Side Caching (10 minutes) for ALL API calls to prevent rate limiting and bans.

### PHASE 2: DATA INGESTION (THE 5 PILLARS)

**Pillar A: Catalysts & Sentiment (The Spark)**
- Source: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP).
- **Analyst Activity:** Fetch Analyst Upgrades/Downgrades for the last 30 days.
   - *Logic:* Bullish if Upgrades > Downgrades.
- **Sentiment:** Fetch Stock News Sentiment. Use the score directly.

**Pillar B: Technical Structure (The Entry)**
- Source: FMP Historical Price -> Processed by `pandas_ta`.
- **MACD (12,26,9):** Bullish if MACD Line > Signal Line.
- **RSI (14):** Bullish if 40 < RSI < 70 (Momentum).
- **Volume Trend:** Bullish if Current Volume > 20-Day SMA Volume.
- **Support Levels:** Calculate the **Lowest Low** of the last 20 days.
   - *Action:* Store this value to display as "Stop Loss Support".

**Pillar C: Relative Value (The Upside)**
- Source: FMP.
- **Analyst Targets:** Fetch average price target.
   - *Logic:* Calculate Upside % = ((Target - Current) / Current).
   - *Score:* >15% upside is Bullish.
- **PEG Ratio:** Fetch PEG. < 1.5 is Bullish.

**Pillar D: Macro Liquidity (The Tide)**
- Source: FRED API (St. Louis Fed).
- **Fetch & Align:** Align Weekly data to Daily using forward-fill.
   - Total Assets: `WALCL` (Weekly)
   - TGA: `WTREGEN` (Weekly)
   - Reverse Repo: `RRPONTSYD` (Daily)
   - Credit Spreads: `BAMLH0A0HYM2` (Daily)
- **Net Liquidity Formula:** `Net_Liq = WALCL - WTREGEN - RRPONTSYD`.
   - *Logic:* Calculate the 20-Day Slope. Positive Slope = Bullish.
- **Credit Spreads:**
   - *Logic:* If Spreads (`BAMLH0A0HYM2`) are > 4.0% OR Trend is Rising -> Bearish (Risk Off).

**Pillar E: Event Risk (The Guardrail)**
- Source: FMP Earnings Calendar.
- **Blackout Rule:** If the Next Earnings Date is within **15 Days** (future):
   - Force Final Recommendation to "WAIT (Earnings)".
   - Set Confidence Score to 0.

### PHASE 3: SCORING & OUTPUT
- Normalize all 5 pillars to a 0-10 scale.
- **Weights:** Technicals (35%), Catalysts (20%), Macro (20%), Value (15%), Fundamentals (10%).
- **Verdict:**
   - 8.0+: "Strong Buy (Sniper Entry)"
   - 6.0-7.9: "Watchlist (Setup Developing)"
   - <6.0: "Pass / Hold"

### PHASE 4: UI & DASHBOARD
1. **Header:** Large "Swing Confidence Score" gauge.
2. **Action Card:** Explicitly show:
   - "Entry Zone" (Current Price)
   - "Stop Loss" (From Pillar B)
   - "Target" (From Pillar C)
3. **Macro Widget:** A line chart showing **"Fed Net Liquidity vs S&P 500"** (normalized).
4. **Share Button:** Use the Web Share API to share the score.
